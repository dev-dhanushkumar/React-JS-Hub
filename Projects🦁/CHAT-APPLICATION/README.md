#### Step 4: Copy Firebase Configuration
You will now see the JavaScript configuration code in a field. Copy this code to paste into your project. 
```js 
// TODO: Replace the following with your app's [Firebase project configuration](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object) 
const firebaseConfig = { 
	//...
 };
 ```

`firebase.js`
```js
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import {
  createUserWithEmailAndPassword,
  getAuth,
  sendPasswordResetEmail,
  signInWithEmailAndPassword,
  signOut,
} from "firebase/auth";
import { collection, doc, getDocs, getFirestore, query, setDoc, where } from "firebase/firestore";
import { toast } from "react-toastify";

const firebaseConfig = {
  // Write Fire base Key Here!
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const db = getFirestore(app);

```
You have successfully set up your Firebase project for your web application. You can now proceed with the implementation of firebase configuration.
### Running the Project
